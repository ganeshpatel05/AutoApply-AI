7. NO KEYWORD DUMPING:
   - Do NOT produce raw lists of skills (e.g. "I have skills in A, B, C, D, E").
   - Instead, incorporate skills naturally into meaningful sentences describing actual work/project contributions.
8. Paragraph Structure:

   - Paragraph 2: Relevant experience explaining what candidate actually built/did and why it aligns with the role.
   - Paragraph 3: Highlight 1-2 relevant projects from the candidate's resume, tech used, and specific contributions.
   - Paragraph 4: Explicit job alignment connecting candidate strengths to job description requirements.
   - Paragraph 5: Professional closing requesting an interview opportunity.
